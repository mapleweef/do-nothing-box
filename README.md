# do-nothing-box
Code for do-nothing-box, an arduino project that does nothing. 

The do nothing box flashes 3 leds. ~95% of the time it will flash green. 5% of the time it will flash yellow. 
There is a 1 in 1000 chance it will flash red, but once it starts flashing red it will cointine flashing red untill a button is pressed
it will also active a buzzer while flashing red.


Still need to make a good circuit diagram
